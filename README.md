### Hi, Iâ€™m Sean ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a front-end developer with 20 months of hands-on experience, specializing in creating responsive and user-friendly web applications. With 15 years in graphic and digital design, I combine technical expertise with creative problem-solving to build modern solutions.

Currently, Iâ€™m working through the Codecademy Front-End Engineer Career Path, where I've been learning everything from HTML/CSS fundamentals to React, testing with JavaScript, and building responsive web applications. Iâ€™m also diving into Computer Science certifications to strengthen my understanding of Python, algorithms, data structures, and databases.

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of my current progress:

#### Front-End Engineer Career Path:
